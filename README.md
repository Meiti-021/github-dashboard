## Description

This website is actually a small and compact project that I made to show my skill level in working with the React framework, REST APIs, as well as UI design and working with some JavaScript libraries.(no css framework used)
<br />
GitHub dashboard, by collecting a series of data from GitHub databases,
displays them in an orderly and visual manner in charts and graphs so that
we can have a deeper understanding of our activities in GitHub

## Language

- Persian
