### Description 
This website is actually a small and compact project that I made to show my skill level in working with the React framework, REST APIs, as well as UI design and working with some JavaScript libraries.(no css framework used)
<br />
GitHub dashboard, by collecting a series of data from GitHub databases,
displays them in an orderly and visual manner in charts and graphs so that
we can have a deeper understanding of our activities in GitHub






#### Special thanks

During the development of this dashboard, i have used many existing resources from awesome developers. i want to thank them for providing their tools open source:

- [React ChartJS 2](http://reactchartjs.github.io/react-chartjs-2/#/) - Simple yet flexible React charting for designers & developers.
- [ChromaJS](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/) - A small-ish zero-dependency JavaScript library for all kinds of color conversions and color scales.

Let us know your thoughts below. And good luck with development!
